        Dear Readers,
      </p>

      <p>
        San Marcos High School's FRC team, the Alpha Knights, recently won FIRST's <strong>Rookie All-Star Award</strong> for the San Diego Regional! Everyone on the team is extremely excited that we won this, as this was our long-term goal for the team this FIRST season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Winning this award means that we'll have a spot reserved for us in the FRC championships in Houston, TX. There's one problem &mdash; it's very expensive (around <strong>$1k/student</strong>) to send our team there, and we need a go-nogo decision by <strong>Tuesday, March 14th</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        By donating to our campaign, you will be supporting a group of young individuals with great potential to succeed through STEM education. We greatly appreciate anything you can contribute &mdash; <strong>thank you</strong>!
      </p>
