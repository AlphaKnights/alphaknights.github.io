        Dear Readers,
      </p>

      <p>
        San Marcos High School's FRC team, the Alpha Knights, recently won FIRST's <strong>Rookie All-Star Award</strong> for the San Diego Regional! Everyone on the team is extremely excited that we won this, as this was our long-term goal for the team this FIRST season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Winning this award means that we'll have a spot reserved for us in the FRC championships in Houston, TX. There's one problem &mdash; it's very expensive (around <strong>$1k/student</strong>) to send our team there, and we need a go-nogo decision by <strong>Tuesday, March 14th</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        By donating to our campaign, you will be supporting a group of young individuals with great potential to succeed through STEM education. We greatly appreciate anything you can contribute &mdash; <strong>thank you</strong>!
      </p>

      We, Alpha Knights, strive to utilize cooperation, innovation, ingenuity, and intellectuality into one cohesive team to grow as the future generation of builders. Our passion for robotics has exponentially cultivated our excitement and enthusiasm for engineering, as many of our students will soon be prospective workers in STEM fields. To inspire, encourage, and stimulate the students of San Marcos is what we aim to do for our community. Ultimately, we aspire to reflect original creativity and bring these designs to life for the future team of San Marcos High School.
