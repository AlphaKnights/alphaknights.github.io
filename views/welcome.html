      We, Alpha Knights, strive to utilize cooperation, innovation, ingenuity, and intellectuality into one cohesive team to grow as the future generation of builders. Our passion for robotics has exponentially cultivated our excitement and enthusiasm for engineering, as many of our students will soon be prospective workers in STEM fields. To inspire, encourage, and stimulate the students of San Marcos is what we aim to do for our community. Ultimately, we aspire to reflect original creativity and bring these designs to life for the future team of San Marcos High School.
